        <h3 class="secondary-title">Hey there!</h3>
        <p class="secondary-paragraph">
          I'm Jake, a wedding + engagement photographer based in Appleton,
          Wisconsin. What started out as a hobby has now turned into my career
          and full time job, although I'm hesitant to even use the word "job,"
          as it truly has never felt like work to me. I have so much fun at
          every wedding that I'm a part of, and the time that I get to spend
          alone with couples who have just dedicated their lives to one another
          is something that I feel truly blessed to experience.
        </p>
        <p class="secondary-paragraph">
          For me, one of the most crucial parts of wedding photography is
          building a relationship between myself and the couples that I work
          with, which results in incredibly comfortable and fun photo shoots.
          From the initial meeting, to the engagement photos, to the final
          moments of the wedding day, we all grow closer and build a lasting
          friendship that goes beyond just a photographer and his clients. I
          know I've done my job when both myself and the newly married couples
          are sad to part ways at the end of the night.
        </p>
        <p class="secondary-paragraph">
          While I’m located in Appleton, Wisconsin, I do love to travel and
          explore new places. Whether you’re a couple looking to get married
          here in Appleton, or elope in Colorado, I’m available everywhere and
          will gladly capture your day anywhere around the U.S.
        </p>
        <p class="secondary-paragraph">
          I've always loved naturally lit, elegant, and candid photos, which
          reflect my style that I aim for at each and every wedding. I've never
          liked awkwardly posed photos myself, so I always make sure everyone
          that I work with feels comfortable and natural throughout the shoot. I
          always edit my photos with those same characteristics in mind -
          natural and elegant. I never oversaturate my photos, and always aim to
          have the photo look exactly the way the moment looked when it
          happened.
        </p>
        <p class="secondary-paragraph">
          The past few years have been an absolute dream. I love meeting new
          people and capturing beautiful moments, and I'd love to be a part of
          the most important day of your life.
